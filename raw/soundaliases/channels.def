# MAX number of channels: 64
# name - the channel name (limited to 64 characters).  Required.
# priority - a numeric priority value where larger numbers take precedence over lower numbers.  Default value = 0
# volume - the master trim volume for voices played on the channel.  Values are in dB.
# is3d - whether this sound is spatialized, and supports occlusion.  3dNoOcc will disable occlusion for 3D voices. ( 2d, 3d, 3dNoOcc ).  Default value = 2d
# wetdry - flags for affecting the levels of the ambient mix. "fulldrylevel" forces the dry level to always be full, "nowetlevel" disables the effect send volume.  Default value is an unaffected dry and wet mix.
# restricted - values (restricted, unrestricted), says whether channel is subject to the one sound per channel per entity rule.  Default value = 'restricted'
# pausable - valuse: (pause, nopause) whether this channel is pausable (e.g. when the in game menu appears).  Default value = "pause"
# max voices - the max number is 64 (though in practice this is smaller becaused of reservered channels for ambience etc...).  Default value = 64
